            <div class="tagline">"You Are the Ocean" is a new media art installation where a participant&rsquo;s brainwaves control a projected ocean simulation. It began traveling to national and international art exhibitions in 2018.</div>
            <h3>Collaborative Art</h3>
            <p>This project was a collaboration with <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ozge_Samanci">Dr. &#214;zge Samanci</a>, a new media artist and Northwestern professor in the Radio, Television, and Film Department. In early 2017, we started the project based on an idea she had for an interactive piece that would symbolize humanity&rsquo;s connection to nature. The installation demonstrates that human thinking has a direct impact on the environment.</p>

            <hr class="captionline">
            <h3>Programming an ocean</h3>
            <p>I was in charge of all programming and implementation for the installation. I built the project using the Unity Game Engine and C#. The installation uses the Neurosky Mindwave, a consumer-oriented neuroheadset we chose for its inexpensiveness and ease of use. A single participant wears the neuroheadset, which measures their general level of focus. The more focus they have, the stormier the ocean becomes. The project was funded by the Undergraduate Research Assistant Program.

            <hr class="captionline">
			<p>Dr. Samanci and I worked in close collaboration, meeting often to refine the installation&rsquo;s design and direction. I spent much of my time working to make the ocean and sky as photorealistic as possible given the constraints of real-time rendering.</p>
			<p>In August 2017, we filmed the demo video for the final project, which you can watch at the top of the page. In this video, you&rsquo;ll see how the installation works and the wonderful ways a person&rsquo;s thoughts can turn an ocean from calm to stormy. Since filming the video, the project has become quite a success, traveling to many selective exhibitions around the world.</p>

            <div class="tagline">"Fiber Optic Ocean" is a virtual reality art installation controlled by live internet activity and the movement of GPS-tracked sharks. A more portable adaptation of an earlier sculptural piece, it was first exhibited in 2019.</div>
            <h3>Adapting art</h3>
            <p>Like "You Are the Ocean," this project was a collaboration with Dr. &#214;zge Samanci. The original piece was designed in 2016 as a physical sculpture composed of 3D-printed shark skeletons and fiber optic threads. In 2019, Dr. Samanci wanted a portable version of the installation that could more easily travel to art exhibitions, so we worked together on the VR implementation of "Fiber Optic Ocean" that debuted at SIGGRAPH 2019.</p>
            <img src="img/FILE.jpg" width="100%"></img>
            <h6 class="caption">Installation view at FILE 2018 in S&#227;o Paulo, Brazil. The projection spans 30 feet, encompassing the entire wall.<br><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">Photo: Camila Picolo</span></h6>
            <hr class="captionline">
            <h3>Human&rsquo;s invasion of the oceans</h3>
            <p>A <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ex7uTQf4bQ&feature=emb_title">viral video</a> from 2010 depicted a little-known threat to the internet: sharks. It turns out sharks like to bite on the underwater internet cables that cut through the world&rsquo;s oceans, a frequent enough occurrence that companies like Google <a target="_blank" href="https://www.wired.com/2014/08/shark-cable/">protect their cables</a> with Kevlar-like sheathing. This inspired Dr. Samanci: the struggle between humans and nature on land is well-known, but little is said about humanity&rsquo;s increasing impact underwater. She conceived "Fiber Optic Ocean" to depict a speculative future, where humans have polluted the oceans with fiber optic cables, entangling and killing off sharks.</p>
            <p>Music and colors are generated in real-time using live data, based on the earlier implementation by Adam Snyder for the sculptural variant. The cables threaded through the sharks blink and change color based on the live movement of GPS-tracked sharks across the world. The cables surrounding the sharks do the same, but use tweets per second as a proxy for human internet use. The generative music utilizes the same data to represent the cries of sharks in their entangled state.</p>
            <p>This was a quick project, started in April of 2019 and completed in time for SIGGRAPH in July of that year. Between our busy schedules, this left little time for polish, but we still did our best to design an environment that did more than simply digitize the original sculpture. The final installation includes schools of fish swimming through the cables, a sandy sea bottom with flora and rock formations, and underwater particle effects. The participant utlizing the VR headset sees the installation from a first-person point of view, while spectators can view a guided third-person perspective from a projector.</p>

            <div class="tagline">At Oscillations, I researched and developed new ways to experience performance art using virtual reality, spatial audio, and interactivity.</div>
            <h3>Defining the future of entertainment</h3>
            <p>Oscillations is a startup working on new ways to create and consume digital entertainment. It consists of a global network of dancers, acrobats, and other performers (Oscillations calls them movement artists). They collaborate with researchers and technologists, who are exploring the latest advancements in neuroscience and immersive technologies to create compelling new experiences.</p>
            <p>Oscillations has a research partnership with Northwestern&rsquo;s Knight Lab for Media Innovation. I became involved with the company when I took a class at the Knight Lab where we consulted on emerging technologies for Oscillations. The company is also actively working on VR music videos and other productions.</p>

            <hr class="captionline">
            <h3>Researching immersive media</h3>
			<p>At the Knight Lab, I researched audience engagement metrics for immersive media, cost-effective motion capture techniques, and spatial audio. These were areas that Oscillations wanted to learn more about.</p>
			<p>Our work in the class culminated in a panel presentation we did alongside Oscillations and a group of professors working in interdisciplinary areas of media, technology, and art. <a target="_blank" href="https://studio.knightlab.com/projects/oscillations-vr/">Check out our final presentation on the Knight Lab website.</a></p>

            <hr class="captionline" id="smallercaptionlines">
            <p>I wanted to do more after the class ended, so I joined Oscillations as a UX Intern over the summer. During my work there, I delved deep into one of the areas I formely researched: spatial audio, which involves situating audio in a 3D environment. Over the summer I developed a novel audio spatialization technique for the company&rsquo;s first VR music video project.</p>
            <p>The project involved assigning individual instruments from the song to individual dancers in the video. This created an immersive experience, where the dancers seemed to create sounds with their movements. I worked on the implementation using the Unity Game Engine and Facebook Spatial Workstation plugins for the Reaper DAW.</p>

            <h3>Products</h3>
            <p>Unfortunately, the projects I worked on have not yet been released to the public, so I don&rsquo;t have much to share currently. However, the interactive VR music video has been submitted to many film festivals, so expect updates soon and an eventual public release.</p>

            <h3>Keeping Runners Safe</h3>
            <p>I am part of a small group of students at Northwestern that develops and deploys the DVS.

          	<hr class="titleunderline">
            <div class="tagline">The Makerspace, located in Northwestern&rsquo;s center for entrepreneurship and innovation, is a ~2,250 sq ft space that I designed, built, and maintain.</div>
            <h3>Technical Consultant</h3>
            <p>I began working at The Garage when it first opened, during the fall of 2015. As a technical consultant, I help manage the technology contained within the space, which includes teaching students, faculty, and visitors how to use the equipment.</p>
            <p>A problem quickly became apparent: The Garage had no central location for its growing collection of 3D printers, CNC mills, and other maker equipment. During the summer of 2016, I had the unique opportunity to convert one of the classrooms into a Makerspace as a full-time internship. The goal was to create a dedicated learning and working environment for students interested in AR, VR, and hardware.</p>

            <hr class="captionline">
            <h3>The Prototyping Lab</h3>
			<p>About two thirds of the space is the Prototyping Lab, dedicated to The Garage&rsquo;s large collection of maker equipment. Along with the IT Manager at The Garage, I designed the layout of the space, housing 3D printers, CNC mills, laser cutters, and woodworking and electronics equipment.</p>

            <hr class="captionline">
            <h3>The AR/VR Lab</h3>
            <p>The Garage also had a growing collection of AR and VR headsets, but no dedicated place to use them. I designed the AR/VR Lab to fill the other third of the space. It contains a dedicated setup with powerful gaming computers to run the latest VR headsets, as well as green walls and flooring for photography, videography, and "mixed reality" recordings of people in VR experiences.</p>

            <h3>Managing the space</h3>
            <p>I still work at The Garage during the school year, continuously maintaining the Makerspace and updating it with the latest technology. The space is used every day by student-led startups that currently incubate at The Garage, especially those working on hardware or AR/VR development. It&rsquo;s also open to the entire Northwestern community for demonstrations of devices such as the Magic Leap One, HTC Vive Pro, and Microsoft HoloLens.</p>

            <h3>UX Design and Research</h3>
            <p>Algorithms and Society was an interdisciplinary seminar class taught by Professor Brent Hecht. Each week, we covered many of the alarming impacts algorithms have on society, from the sharing economy to the filter bubble. As part of a quarter-long group project, we had to address one of the problems discussed in class. My group attempted to tackle a big one: fake news.</p>
            <p>Building off of existing research on algorithmic methods of fake news detection, we addressed user interface concerns for what a fake news detection tool would look like. We targeted the Facebook News Feed because of its well-known issues with fake news during the 2016 U.S. presidential election. We devised an interface motivated by relevant HCI and cognitive psychology research, ran user testing experiments on our prototypes, and analyzed our findings in a final paper.</p>

            <h3>Prototyping in VR</h3>
            <p>In this Knight Lab Studio class, I joined a group of three other students to explore the fledgling space of VR data visualizations. We spent our quarter researching best practices of 2D visualizations and virtual reality, and designing low-fidelity prototypes using tools like Tilt Brush. We then compiled our findings into an interactive website, complete with a comprehensive list of existing resources for data visualization in VR.</p>
            <p>We found that the added dimensionality, immersion, and interaction afforded by VR makes it an ideal platform for a new generation of data visualizations that can grant the user unprecedented perspective. At the same time, many data visualizations do not translate well into VR, and care must be taken to create an optimal VR experience.</p>

          	<hr class="titleunderline">
            <div class="tagline">Catnip is a mobile app developed out of a year-long project dedicated to helping Northwestern students manage their time.</div>
            <h3>Human-centered design</h3>
            <p>Catnip began as a design project between me and two other students. We went through countless iterations and user testing trials to create a solution that would benefit as many students as possible. Initially known as Project Catnip (Go 'Cats!), by the end of the quarter we called it NU 101.</p>
            <p>The main features of the app are a priority-based calendar, an automated calendar entry system, and school-based messaging. Our trials showed students benefitted from a calendar that didn&rsquo;t just show time allocated to tasks, but also priority given to those tasks. Our priority calendar was also easy-to-use because it could scrape from existing calendars and Northwestern sites.</p>
        	<p>The messaging feature allowed students to connect with peers in their classes or student organizations. We also devised a rollout strategy that would integrate with the freshman orientation program to encourage high adoption rates for the app.</p>

            <h3>Advancing the project</h3>
            <p>The idea was popular enough that it was adopted by upper-level design students as a two-quarter project to further refine and implement our ideas. While our final prototype was purely visual and nonfunctional, this group of four students was tasked with bringing in a level of functionality.</p>
            <p>My original group and I acted as clients for the new group, offering continuous feedback and guidance to meet the original goals of our project. By the end of their project period, the app was capable of some of our original goals, such as scraping from Canvas, our class management site, as well as Caesar, our general Northwestern portal. They also created new app renderings, such as the one above.</p>

            <p>One rainy day during the fall of 2016, I walked by the dumpsters outside of Northwestern&rsquo;s fraternities, and saw this beautiful Mortal Kombat II arcade cabinet just sitting there. I couldn&rsquo;t imagine why someone would throw it out, until I got closer and realized it was missing its entire controls panel, with severed wires dangling from the opening. I got a group together to rescue it from the rain. We talked about restoring it and making it the centerpiece of our dorm, but classes and a lack of funds for new parts got in the way.</p>

            <h3>Restoration</h3>
            <p>In early 2017, I asked the executive director of The Garage if I could bring it there to work on it. Not only did she accept, but she also offered to buy the necessary parts for its restoration. I began to repair it, with help from Ben Williams, Akash Borde, Ryan Miller, and Beth Mallon at different points throughout the process.</p>
	      <p>We started by simply replacing the frayed power cable, which turned out to be all it needed to work again, although it wasn&rsquo;t of much use without its joysticks and buttons. Throughout the spring of 2017, we continued to restore it, assembling a new controls panel and rewiring all the parts. By the end of the spring, it worked flawlessly, as if the panel had never been missing.</p>

            <h3>Pushing boundaries</h3>
        	<p>But I wanted it to do more. I ordered a Raspberry Pi and conversion board to hook up the buttons, joysticks, and original CRT with the Pi, and after some software fiddling, we had a versatile arcade cabinet that could play everything from Pac Man to Galaga thanks to emulators.</p>
	    <p>However, manually adding and configuring games was a pain, so we transitioned to using the Pandora&rsquo;s Box, a board pre-loaded with over 600 arcade games. We also added a smart power switch that could turn off the cabinet after a certain period of inactivity in order to conserve its original (and increasingly rare) CRT. The last addition was an adapter that allowed for quick switching between the original Mortal Kombat II board and the Pandora&rsquo;s Box.</p>
	    <p>Today, it lives in the AR/VR Lab of The Garage, offering the quintessential arcade cabinet experience that every co-working space should have.</p>

            It stands in Lincoln Park, on Chicago's north side. Over several months, I researched and filmed the building in an effort to explore its connection
            with Chicago and classical antiquity. It is a building that is obviously inspired by ancient Rome, especially in its resemblance to the Pantheon. But
             more interestingly, it also borrows greatly from American ideals and symbology. Overall, I found the Elks Memorial to be less of a Chicagoan
             building, and more of a national one. These findings are summarized in the video I created below.</p>
