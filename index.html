            <h2 >The Data Visualization System (DVS) is used by race officials at multiple events, including the Chicago Marathon,
            the second largest marathon in the world.</h2>
            <p>I am part of a small group of students at Northwestern that develops and deploys the DVS. We work under the
            direction of Professor Karen Smilowitz in the Department of Industrial Engineering. Currently, the system is in use at
            four annual events: the Bank of America Chicago Marathon, Chevron Houston Marathon, Aramco Half Marathon, and Bank of America Shamrock Shuffle.
            The DVS tracks the progress and medical information of thousands of runners, keeping race officials stationed
            at forward command tents informed about the status and well-being of participants.</p>
            <p>I joined the team during the spring of 2017, and I spent my summer overhauling the DVS. We transitioned the DVS
            to a responsive, mobile-friendly web app deployed on the LAMP stack. My biggest contribution was rewriting and
            redesigning the dynamic course map implementation that displays runner density and GPS locations of pacers.
            I built the map using the Mapbox GL JS API.</p>
            <p>We deploy the DVS at the Chicago Marathon in October, the Houston Marathon and Half Marathon in January, and the Shamrock Shuffle in March. We are also pursuing expansion and eventual commercialization of the DVS.</p>
            <p>Our system was awarded the prestigious INFORMS Innovative Applications in Analytics Award in April 2018.
            We competed against the other finalists at the INFORMS Business Analytics Conference in Baltimore, including IBM, Macy's, BNSF, and Schneider.</p>

            <h2>"You Are the Ocean" is an interactive art installation where the participant's brain waves
            control a projected ocean simulation. It began traveling to national and international art exhibitions in 2018.</h2>
            <p>This project was a collaboration with Ozge Samanci, an interactive media artist and Northwestern Professor in the Radio, Television, and Film Department.
            In early 2017, we started the project based on an idea she had for a new
            interactive piece that would symbolize humanity's connection to nature.</p>
            <p>I was in charge of all programming and implementation for the installation. I built the project using
            the Unity Game Engine, C#, and the Neurosky Mindwave headset, with funding from the Undergraduate Research Assistant Program. In August 2017,
            we filmed the demo video for the final product, which you can watch below.</p>

            </div>
            <p>Now that the project is complete,

            <h2>The Makerspace, located in Northwestern's center for 
            entrepreneurship and innovation, is a ~2,250 sq ft space that I  designed, built, and maintain.</h2>
            <p>I began working at The Garage when it first opened, during the fall of 2015. 
            As a "tech aide," I would help manage the growing collection of cutting-edge tech contained within the space. Throughout my
            first year there, devices like 3D printers and CNC mills started cluttering the entryway of The Garage, because there
            was no central location for maker equipment. During the summer of 2016, I had the unique opportunity to convert one of the
            classrooms into a Makerspace as a full-time internship.</p>
            <img src="prototyping.jpg" width="100%"></img>
            <p>About two thirds of the space is the Prototyping Lab, dedicated to The Garage's large collection of maker equipment.
            Along with the IT Manager at The Garage, I designed the layout of the space, housing 3D printers, CNC mills, woodworking and electronics
            equipment, and space for future equipment.</p>
            <img src="mixedreality.jpg" width="100%"></img>
            <p>The Garage also had a growing collection of VR and AR headsets, but no dedicated place to use them.
            I designed the AR/VR Lab to fill the other third of the space. It contains a dedicated setup with powerful gaming computers to run the latest VR
            headsets, as well as green walls and flooring for photography, videography, and "mixed reality" recordings of people in VR experiences. This type
            of recording can be seen in the photo above: on the large screen, people can see exactly what the person in VR is doing from a third-person perspective.</p>
            <p>I still work at The Garage during the school year, continuously updating and maintaining the Makerspace. The space gets use every day among
            the several hardware startups that are currently incubating at The Garage, as well as the multiple startups that are working on VR/AR development.
            It's also open to the entire Northwestern community for demos of cutting-edge AR/VR tech, such as the Magic Leap One, Oculus Rift, and Microsoft HoloLens.</p>
            <img src="garage.jpg" width="100%"></img>
            <p>I also wrote the pages on The Garage website that detail all of the equipment contained in the <a target="_blank" href="https://thegarage.northwestern.edu/resources/prototyping-lab/"><b>Prototyping Lab</b></a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://thegarage.northwestern.edu/resources/ar-vr-lab/"><b>VR/AR Lab</b></a>, as
            well as The Garage help desk articles. Check out the pages to see detailed lists of all the equipment contained in the space. I still love working
            at The Garage, not only because I get to see a space I created in constant use, but also because I love using the space myself! I'm a huge
            VR geek, as you can tell from the above photo. I am often the one that convinces The Garage what latest high-tech gadget to buy next.</p>

            <h2>The Facebook News Feed has a fake news problem. This project attempts to address it from a user interface perspective.</h2>
            <p>Algorithms and Society was a highly interdisciplinary seminar class taught by Professor Brent Hecht. Each week, we covered
            one of many alarming impacts algorithms have on society, from the sharing economy to the filter bubble. As part of a quarter-long group project,
            we were tasked with attempting to ameliorate one of the problems discussed in class. My group took a stab at tackling a massive one: fake news.</p>
            <p>Building off of existing research on algorithmic methods of fake news detection, we addressed user interface concerns for what a fake news detection tool
            would look like. We devised an interface motivated by relevant HCI and cognitive psychology research, ran user testing experiments on our prototypes, and analyzed our findings
            in a final paper.</p>

            <h2>At Northwestern's lab for media innovation, I explored the immense possibilities and best practices for data visualizations in virtual reality.</h2>
            <p>Every quarter the Knight Lab runs various studio projects. During the winter quarter of 2017, I joined a group of three other students to
            explore the fledgling space of VR data visualizations. We spent our quarter researching best practices of 2D visualizations and virtual reality, and designing
             low-fidelity prototypes using tools like Tilt Brush. We then compiled our findings into an interactive website, complete with a comprehensive list
             of existing resources for data visualization in VR.</p>
             <p>We found that the added dimensionality, immersion, and interaction afforded by VR makes it a wonderful platform for a new generation of data

             care must be taken to create an optimal VR experience.</p>

            <h2>Catnip is a mobile app developed out of a year-long project dedicated to helping Northwestern students manage their time.</h2>
            <p>It began as a design project between me and two other students. We went through countless iterations and user testing trials to create a solution
            that would benefit as many students as possible. Initially known as Project Catnip (Go 'Cats!), by the end of the quarter we called it NU 101.</p>
            <p>However, the idea was popular enough that it was taken up by upper-level design students as a two-quarter project to further refine and implement our
            ideas. While our final prototype was purely visual and nonfunctional, this group of four students was tasked with bringing in a level of functionality. 
            My original group and I acted as clients for the new group, offering continuous feedback and guidance to meet the original goals of our project. By the end 
            of their project period, the app was capable of some of our original goals, such as scraping from Canvas, our class management site, as well as 
            Caesar, our general Northwestern portal. They also created the professional rendering of the app that is displayed here.</p>
            <p>The main features of the app are a priority-based calendar, automated entry system, and school-based messaging. Our trials showed students 
            benefitted from a calendar that didn't just show time allocated to tasks, but also priority given to those tasks. Our priority calendar was
             also easy-to-use because it could scrape from existing calendars and Northwestern sites. The messaging feature allowed students to connect with 
             peers in their classes or student organizations. We also devised a rollout strategy that would integrate with the freshman orientation program to 
             encourage high adoption rates for the app.</p>

            <h2>This project, which covers a blend of architecture, classics, and Chicago history, is part of a larger exploration of Ancient Rome's influences on Chicago.</h2>
            <p>The Elks National Memorial is a war memorial built for the Benevolent and Protective Order of Elks, one of America's largest fraternal organizations. 
            It stands in Lincoln Park, on Chicago's north side. Over several months, I researched and filmed the building in an effort to explore its connection
            with Chicago and classical antiquity. It is a building that is obviously inspired by ancient Rome, especially in its resemblance to the Pantheon. But
             more interestingly, it also borrows greatly from American ideals and symbology. Overall, I found the Elks Memorial to be less of a Chicagoan
             building, and more of a national one. These findings are summarized in the video I created below.</p>

            <h2>I found this arcade cabinet in a dumpster, brought it back to life, and now it can play just about any arcade game.</h2>
            <p>One rainy day during the fall of 2016, I walked by the dumpsters outside of Northwestern's fraternities, and saw this beautiful Mortal Kombat II
            arcade cabinet just sitting there. I couldn't imagine why someone would throw it out, until I got closer and realized it was missing its entire
            controls panel, with severed wires dangling from the opening. I got a group together to rescue it from the rain. We talked about restoring it and making
            it the centerpiece of our dorm, but classes and a lack of funds for new parts got in the way.</p>
            <p>In early 2017, I asked the executive director of The Garage if I could bring it there to work on it. Not only did she accept, but she also
            offered to buy the necessary parts for its restoration. I started by simply replacing the frayed power cable, plugging it in, and lo and behold - it 
            worked again! Throughout the spring of 2017, I continued to restore it, assembling a new controls panel and rewiring all the parts. By the end of 
            the spring, it worked flawlessly, as if the panel had never been missing.</p>
            <p>But I wanted it to do more. I ordered a Raspberry Pi and conversion board to hook up the buttons, joysticks, and original CRT with the Pi, and
            after some software fiddling, I had a versatile arcade cabinet that could play everything from Pac Man to Galaga thanks to emulators. While I had it 
            working roughly by the end of spring, I'm continuing to refine the software to make the user experience optimal. Eventually, I should be able to 
            switch between the original Mortal Kombat II board and the Pi with a press of a button.</p>
            <p>Today, it lives in the VR Lab of The Garage, offering the quintessential arcade cabinet experience that every co-working space should have.</p>
